NJ Transit Scheduler
===================

Prerequisites
-----------
- python 2.7
- virtualenv

Instructions
-----------
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Purpose of this project is to create a polling script that consumes the NJ Transit real time tracker and spits it out in easy to read form.  This will eventually be ported onto a Raspberry Pi connected to a small display so I will never have to use the website again.
